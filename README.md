# React boilerplate with TypeScript and a Context store

This repository contains my preferences for bootstrapping a new React project. Feel free to take a look at package.json to see the specific tools I like to use to scaffold the base requirements for my projects.

## Why not CRA?

I always used create-react-app for my projects in the past when I was starting out, however, after countless side projects I had to admit to myself that I didn't know anything about tooling. So, I took my time and spent some weeks learning about modern JavaScript tooling, which eventually led me to make my own boilerplate.

## More to come!

I'll continue to update this repository as I learn more about the React and JavaScript ecosystem. Most likely I'll switch out Parcel to Webpack, esbuild or Snowpack, depending on which technology I learn first.
